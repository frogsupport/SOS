# SOS

The SOS board game. The goal is to place 'SOS's in a line using the 'S' and 'O' game pieces.
This game was made for the UMKC CS449 Fall 2022 SOS project.

## How to Use

1. Pull this repo down to your local machine
2. This game was developed using Intellij IDEA, so opening it in that IDE would be preferable. However, 
I believe it is also possible to run an Intellij project in other IDE's.
3. To run with Intellij, open the project in Intellij
4. Reload the Maven dependencies
5. Run the SosGui.java file
6. The SOS game should now be running

## Game Types

There are two different game types, Simple Game and General game.

### Simple Game

Try to make a single SOS in a row. The first to do so wins.

### General Game

Try to make as many SOS's as possible. The winner is the player with the most SOS's at the end of the game.
If you make an SOS, then you get to go again.
